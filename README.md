Textbook: PHP and MySQL for Dynamic Web Sites: Visual QuickPro Guide (5th Edition) Written by Larry Ullman

Read Chapter 11 of your textbook, completing each exercise.  

Note: You will need access to an email server to complete a number of exercises in this chapter.  Your version of XAMPP has a form of "Sendmail" that will allow you to forward your email-enabled PHP scripts to your Davis Tech Gmail account (firstname.lastname####@mail.datc.edu).  The following document Download documentshould help you enable this functionality.  You may also find:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15965376/how-to-configure-xampp-to-send-mail-from-localhost Links to an external site. helpful.

Understand that setting up email can take a bunch of "well, just fiddling"; since the point of this course is PHP and not becoming an email admin or "fixit guru": Give this the good old college try.  So spend an hour or two tops on trying to get the email to work, then just go ahead and write your "working" code even if you can't get it to send mail to your account.  I will not hold account problems against you.

Submission: Please take and submit .png screenshots showing your working code running in a browser and your source code for 11.1, 11.2, 11.4, 11.5, and 11.6; place all files in a .zip file.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
